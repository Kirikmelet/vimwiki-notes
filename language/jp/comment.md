Think about it in reverse - which particle would you put there? It doesn't get a は - 24 hours isn't the topic of the sentence. It doesn't get a が - 24 hours isn't the subject either. It's not the direct object so it doesn't get a を. You're not having the party "via" the 24 hours, so no で. No に since 24 hours isn't a specific time that you're partying at. The 24 hours don't belong to the party, so no の. You're not quoting the party, so no と. There are obviously tons more particles but these are the ones covered so far and you get where I'm going with this.

You don't need a particle there simply because there isn't one that really fits there. It might be easier to understand if you mentally reword the English sentence to, "I will have a 24-hour party" instead of the exact sentence Duo gave you for this example. These sentences are basically identical in English, right? Yet you probably don't think you need a particle in translating "24-hour party."

から is a particle meaning 'from'/marking the starting point, まで is a particle meaning 'to'/marking the end point. It's used with time, places, numerical quantity etc. 火曜日から = 'from Tuesday' or 'starting Tuesday'. 土曜日まで = 'until Saturday'.
