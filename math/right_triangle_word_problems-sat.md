Turning radius of 45in wheelbase with 10^o^.

=== Workings ===

sin(10^o^) ~ 0.174

cos(10^o^) ~ 0.985

tan(10^o^) ~ 0.176


R = 45^o^

sin(10^o^) = 45/R

R * sin(10^o^) = 45

*_R = 45/sin(10^o^)_*

SSR is short yet steep up ramp.

LLSR is long yet not steep up ramp

Find diff between SSR and LLSR

_To tenth of foot_

SSR:

	Base = 24ft
	
	Height = 2ft
	
LLSR:

	Base = (sqrt[SSR_BASE^2^ + SSR_HEIGHT^2^])
	
	Height = 8ft
	
=== Workings ===

SSR = sqrt(BASE^2^ + HEIGHT^2^)

SSR = sqrt(24^2^ + 2^2^)

SSR = sqrt(576 + 4)

SSR = sqrt(580)

SSR = 24.08318915758ft

LLSR = sqrt(576 + 16)

LLSR = sqrt(592)

LLSR = 24.33105012119ft

LLSR ~ 24.3ft

DIFF = SSR - LLSR

DIFF = 24.1 - 24.3

DIFF = 0.2ft

=== Corrections ===

LLSR = sqrt(24.08^2^ + 16)

LLSR = sqrt(580 + 16)

LLSR = sqrt(596)

LLSR = 25.38

DIFF = 25.38 - 24.08

Ladder is on wall.

Top is 9ft above ground

If ladder is moved 3ft away from ground, ladder will be flat.

How long is the ladder (in ft)


=== Corrections ===

0 = X/(Y + 3)

Y^2^ + 9^2^ = X^2^

Y^2^ + 81 = (Y + 3)^2^

Y^2^ + 81 = Y^2^ + 6Y + 9

Y^2^ - Y^2^ + 81 - 9 = 6Y

X = Y + 3

X = 12 + 3
